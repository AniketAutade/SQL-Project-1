# Project 1- International Football Results from 1872-2017

This SQL project is one of the projects to demonstrate my SQL skills to use various concepts using MySQL. In addition, I am able to work on SQL-database using Jupyter Notebooks in Python. 

# Dataset Information
This dataset includes 43,170 results of international football matches starting from the very first official match in 1972 up to 2019. The matches range from FIFA World Cup to FIFI Wild Cup to regular friendly matches. The matches are strictly men's full internationals and the data does not include Olympic Games or matches where at least one of the teams was the nation's B-team, U-23 or a league select team.

# Approach

Code has been written using Anaconda-Jupyter Notebook. Database has been created in MySQL workbench using Python and results are showcased as a dataframe. The approach to this dataset is simple and straightforward. I make an attempt to showcase different insights using SQL queries. Also note that I am not using the Seaborn or the Matplot libraries in this version.

The future version may have more visualized outcomes using different libraries in python.
